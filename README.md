# GeneralRobloxAiModule
A generalized module for roblox ai

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello and thank you for choosing to use my AI module. 

A few things to note:

* This module is very new and there could potentially be bugs that haven't been handled. Thus I ask for your patience because they will be dealt with in due time. 

* To use the module you need to place the module within the humanoid npc of your choice and configure it using the example config file as a reference. 

* From then on you just make your own functions and throw them in there! 

* NOT USABLE YET BECAUSE I HAVEN'T ADDED THE COMBAT CONTROLLER REQUIRED FOR THE AI TO DO DAMAGE

Have fun!
