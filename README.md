# GeneralRobloxAiModule
A generalized module for roblox ai

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello and thank you for choosing to use my AI module. 

A few things to note:

1. This module is very new and there could potentially be bugs that haven't been handled. Thus I ask for your patience because they will be dealt with in due time. 

2. To use the module you need to place the module within the humanoid npc of your choice and configure it using the example config file as a reference. 

3. From then on you just make your own functions and throw them in there! 

Have fun!
